# CANPi WebSocket Adapter

Welcome to CANPi WebSocket Adapter project.

The MERG-CANPi WebSocket Adapter is a service that is designed to run on a RaspberryPi attached to a CAN module transceiver.
The service acts as an adapter between the upstream MERG-CANGrid connection of the CANPi Server
and a downstream Web Socket interface.
This will allow communication between MERG-CBUS and web pages written in Javascript.
